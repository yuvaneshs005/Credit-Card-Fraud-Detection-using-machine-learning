# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-machine-learning
Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying unauthorized or fraudulent transactions made using credit cards, which can result from stolen card details, identity theft, or unauthorized purchases. Due to the vast number of transactions occurring daily, manual detection is inefficient and prone to errors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to automate fraud detection by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies. Given the challenge of highly imbalanced dataâ€”where fraudulent cases are rareâ€”the project incorporates feature engineering, resampling methods, and classification algorithms like Random Forest to improve detection accuracy. The goal is to develop a reliable fraud detection system that minimizes false positives while effectively flagging fraudulent transactions, helping financial institutions enhance security and reduce financial losses.

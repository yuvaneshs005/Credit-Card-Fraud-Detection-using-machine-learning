# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-machine-learning
Credit card fraud detection involves identifying unauthorized transactions that may result from stolen card details, identity theft, or fraudulent purchases. Due to the large volume of daily transactions, manual detection is inefficient and error-prone. This project leverages machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to automate fraud detection by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies.

Given the challenge of highly imbalanced dataâ€”where fraudulent transactions are rareâ€”the project implements feature engineering, precision-recall optimization, and classification metrics to enhance detection accuracy. By minimizing false positives while effectively flagging fraudulent activities, this model provides a reliable fraud detection system, assisting financial institutions in enhancing security and reducing financial losses.
